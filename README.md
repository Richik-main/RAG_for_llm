Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that retrieves documents from a vector database and uses a language model (LLM) from Hugging Face to generate context-aware results. The system leverages the advantages of both retrieval-based methods and generative models, providing more accurate and context-driven answers by utilizing relevant information from the vector database.

Project Structure
The repository contains the following files and directories:

Rag_project/: This folder contains the core project files related to the retrieval and generation tasks.
Creation of a fiass db.pptx: A presentation detailing the creation of a FAISS vector store (database) used for fast similarity search.
README.md: The current documentation for the project.
paper_parser.py: A script used to parse documents (likely papers or other textual data) into manageable chunks for embedding and storage.
retrieval_Generation_Application.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the workflow for retrieving documents and generating results using the context retrieved from the vector store.
Workflow
Data Preparation:

Text documents are broken down into smaller chunks. These chunks are then embedded using an embedding model.
The embeddings are stored in a vector database (in this case, FAISS is used) which acts as the long-term memory for the LLM.
Retrieval:

When a query is made, the system retrieves relevant chunks from the vector store by searching for vectors most similar to the query vector.
The vector store retrieves the top matches and provides them as context for the generation process.
Generation:

The Hugging Face LLM takes the retrieved context from the vector store and generates a final response, leveraging the relevant information.
This combination of retrieved context and generative capabilities improves the accuracy and relevance of the results.
Key Features
Vector Database (FAISS): The system uses FAISS, a library for efficient similarity search, to store and retrieve document embeddings. FAISS enables fast and scalable retrieval operations, making it suitable for large datasets.

Hugging Face LLM: The project utilizes a language model from Hugging Face for generating text. The LLM is fine-tuned to use the context from retrieved documents to produce coherent and accurate outputs.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd Rag_project
Install the required dependencies (using pip or conda):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up FAISS and ensure the vector store is properly initialized by following the steps in the Creation of a fiass db.pptx presentation.

Usage
Document Parsing and Vector Creation:

Run the paper_parser.py script to parse your document and chunk it into smaller segments.
The script will automatically embed these chunks and store them in the FAISS vector store.
Text Retrieval:

Run the retrieval_Generation_Application.ipynb notebook to perform text retrieval and generation.
The notebook will guide you through the process of querying the vector database and generating context-aware responses using the LLM.
Future Enhancements
Additional Model Support: Implement more sophisticated retrieval methods or incorporate other generative models for comparison.
Scalability: Extend the project to handle larger datasets and more complex retrieval tasks.
Improved Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for uploading documents and querying the system.
Conclusion
This RAG project provides a flexible framework for combining document retrieval and language model generation, enhancing the ability to generate relevant and contextually accurate results. The integration of FAISS for fast retrieval and Hugging Face LLM for generation makes this system a powerful tool for a wide variety of text generation tasks.
