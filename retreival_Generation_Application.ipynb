It alternates between low-rank approximation and training, while maintaining the capacity of the original network. The goal of TRP is to prune a whole model layer by layer while minimizing the overall prediction error of the pruned deep neural network. This is achieved by providing a bound for reconstructed errors for each pruning operation in each layer, which enables efficient pruning without sacrificing overall performance. TRP is motivated by the strategies of training quantized nets and aims to reduce the computational complexity and storage requirements of deep neural networks.\n"
